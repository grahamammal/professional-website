As part of my Software Design and Development class, my team of four created an iOS and Android app to facilitate the real life game *Assassin*, in which you and a group of friends hunt each other in order to be the last one alive.

The app exists on two GitHub repositories, one for the [app](https://github.com/jacobdweightman/comp225-assassin) and one for the [server](https://github.com/grahamammal/comp225-server). The app was built in React Native, and the server was built in Flask. We hosted the server on Heroku, but that may no longer be up as we've stopped maintaining this project.

During the project I wrote the majority of the server. To implement it, I had to learn python, flask, and generally how servers worked. I also learned a lot about the usefulness of automated testing, which saved our project from disaster multiple times.

Here are some screenshots of the project:
