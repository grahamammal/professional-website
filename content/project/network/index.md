For my Network Science capstone class, my class partner Brian White and created a network of senate voting patterns, where senators who vote together often are linked, to see if it could capture rising polarization in American politics. Not only did it do this, but it picked up on the trend shockingly well, and even pointed to other points in American history where polarization was high, such as during the Whig Party rebellion in 1848. Our project can be found [here](/files/network-capstone.html).
