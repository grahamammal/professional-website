For my summer research after my junior year of undergrad, I interned at the Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars Program at the University of Virginia. We partnered with local governments, in my case with the Charlottesville and Albemarle County emergency medical services teams to understand how COVID-19 has changed service delivery, with a special focus on ensuring historically marginalized groups weren't disproportionately affected by COVID-19 on EMS delivery. This work can be found [here](https://dspg-young-scholars-program.github.io/dspg20CharlottesvilleEMSEquity/). I also helped with a team partnered with Halifax County, VA. We focused on what interventions, such as increased school funding, could help reduce incarceration and recidivism in the county.
