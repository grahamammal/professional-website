Hello! I'm a junior at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) studying for an applied math and statistics and a computer science double major. Recently I've been working on a project to connect statistics students with community organizations to add context and meaning to projects that we do, and having fun meeting highland cows while studying abroad at the [University of St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Scotland. Last summer I did research on clustering categorical longitudinal data with one of my professors, [Brianna Heggeseth](https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth).

When I'm not studying I love to cook! If you ever meet me make sure ask me to make you something! I may not be a great cook but at least I'm an enthusiastic one!
