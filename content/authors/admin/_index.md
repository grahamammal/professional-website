I'm a junior at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) studying for an applied math and statistics major. This summer, I'm working with the University of Virginia, Arlington in their Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars Program. I'm working with government and academia to solve social problems using data science techniques. Last summer I did research on clustering categorical longitudinal data with one ,of my professors [Brianna Heggeseth](https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth).
