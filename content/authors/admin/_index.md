I just finished my Bachelor of Arts at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) with an applied math and statistics major and a computer science minor. This summer, I'm preparing for beginning the Biostatstics PhD program at the University of Washington in the fall, as well as doing consulting work for local governments and organizations with [David Keyes](https://rfortherestofus.com/author/dgkeyes/) of [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/).
