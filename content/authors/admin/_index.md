I'm a senior at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) studying for an applied math and statistics major. This past summer, I worked with the University of Virginia, Arlington in their Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars Program. I worked with government and academia to solve social problems using data science techniques. Right now, I've been working on my statistics honors thesis, focused on extending an existing computationally efficient method for spatial modeling to the temporal domain.
